Using a trademark (TM) is an important part of protecting your brand and ensuring that you have exclusive rights to use the mark. But when should you use a TM and when should you use a registered trademark (®)?

Using a TM is a good way to establish yourself in the marketplace and to protect your brand. You can use a TM on a logo, slogan, product name, or any type of branding material. You can place a TM next to the mark when you first introduce it to the public. This will help to distinguish your product from other similar products and will notify potential infringers that the mark is being claimed as a trademark.

However, for your trademark to be legally protected, you must register it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Once your trademark is registered, you may use the ® symbol instead of the TM symbol. This symbol is used to indicate that the trademark has been registered and is legally protected.

If you are using a mark that you have not yet registered, it is important that you use the TM symbol. This will help to protect your rights to the mark and will make it easier to register the mark later on. If someone else has already been using a similar mark and registered it with the USPTO, using the TM symbol may allow you to continue using the mark without infringing on the other person’s rights.

Using the TM symbol is an important part of protecting your brand and ensuring that you have exclusive rights to use the mark. It is important to use the TM symbol when you first introduce your mark to the public and to use the ® symbol once your trademark has been registered. This will help to protect your rights and ensure that you have exclusive use of your mark.
