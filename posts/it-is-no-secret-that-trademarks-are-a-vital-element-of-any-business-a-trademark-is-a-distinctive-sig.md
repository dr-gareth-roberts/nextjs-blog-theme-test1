It is no secret that trademarks are a vital element of any business. A trademark is a distinctive sign or symbol that identifies the goods and services of one business from another, and in legal terms, it is considered to be a form of intellectual property. But what does the term ‘common law trademark’ mean?

Common law trademark is a legal concept that is based on common law principles and is applicable to the United States. It refers to the legal protection that a business can gain from a trademark that it has been using for some period of time. This protection is granted without the need to register the trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

To be entitled to common law trademark protection, a business must show that it has used the trademark in commerce for some period of time. Generally, the more the trademark has been used, the more likely it is that the business will have a strong ownership claim over the trademark. In addition, the business must be able to prove that the trademark is distinctive and that it is associated in the public’s mind with the goods and services of the business.

Common law trademarks provide a business with certain rights, such as the right to prevent others from using a similar mark in the same geographic area. However, common law trademarks do not provide the same level of protection as federally registered trademarks. For example, common law trademarks do not provide the owner with exclusive nationwide rights, and they do not provide the same level of legal remedies as federally registered trademarks.

In conclusion, common law trademark is a legal concept that provides a business with certain rights over a trademark that it has been using for some period of time, without the need to register the trademark with the USPTO. While common law trademarks provide certain rights, they do not offer the same level of protection as federally registered trademarks.
