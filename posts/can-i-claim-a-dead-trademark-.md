Can I Claim a Dead Trademark?

Trademarks are an important form of intellectual property protection. In many countries, the registration of a trademark guarantees exclusive rights to the use of a particular mark in connection with the goods or services for which it is registered. But, what happens when the trademark is no longer in use or “dead”? Can you still claim a dead trademark?

The answer is yes, but with certain limitations. In most countries, trademark rights are not perpetual and can expire after a certain period of time. A trademark can be deemed “dead” when it is no longer being used in commerce. This can happen if the company that owned the trademark stops using it for any reason, or if the company is no longer in business.

When a trademark is deemed dead, it can be available for someone else to register and use. This is often the case with older trademarks that have been abandoned by the original owners. The process of claiming a dead trademark is similar to registering a new trademark. You will have to conduct a trademark search to make sure that the mark is not already in use. If the mark is available, you can file an application to register the mark with the relevant trademark office.

However, you should be aware that there are certain risks associated with claiming a dead trademark. First, you may not be able to use the mark in all countries or in all contexts. Also, if the original owner of the trademark decides to revive their trademark and start using it again, they may be able to challenge your registration.

In conclusion, it is possible to claim a dead trademark, but it is important to understand the risks and limitations associated with doing so. If you are considering registering a dead trademark, it is always best to consult with a qualified intellectual property attorney to ensure that you are taking all the necessary steps to protect your rights.
