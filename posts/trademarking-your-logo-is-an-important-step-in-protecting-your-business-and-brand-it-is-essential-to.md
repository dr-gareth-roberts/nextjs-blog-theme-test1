Trademarking your logo is an important step in protecting your business and brand. It is essential to secure exclusive rights to the logo’s use in order to prevent others from using it without permission. In India, you can trademark your logo by applying for a trademark registration. Here’s a guide on how to do it:

Step 1: Choose a Filing Basis:

When filing for a trademark in India, you must choose the filing basis which best suits your business. You can choose between a “proposed to be used” and an “already in use” filing basis. 

Step 2: Prepare the Trademark Application:

Once you have chosen your filing basis, you must prepare a trademark application form. This form should include details such as the name of the logo, its description, and other relevant information. The form must be signed and accompanied by the necessary documents.

Step 3: Pay the Filing Fee:

The filing fee for trademark registration in India is ₹4,000 for individuals and ₹8,000 for businesses. The fee can be paid online or in person at the trademark registration office.

Step 4: Submit the Application:

Once the application form and the fee have been submitted, the trademark office will review the application and decide if it meets the necessary criteria. Once it is approved, your logo will be registered and you will receive a registration certificate.

Step 5: Renew the Trademark:

In India, trademarks need to be renewed every 10 years. You can renew your trademark by submitting a renewal form and paying the renewal fee.

Trademarking your logo is an important step in protecting your business and brand. It is a wise investment that will help ensure that your logo is securely yours and that no one else can use it without your permission. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily trademark your logo in India.
