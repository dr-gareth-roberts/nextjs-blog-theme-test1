When you decide to protect your brand, one of the most important steps you can take is to file an Intent to Use trademark. This is the first step in the trademark registration process, and it’s essential for protecting your brand from copycats or competitors. But when it comes to the cost of filing an Intent to Use trademark, it can be difficult to figure out how much you’ll need to pay. 

The cost of filing an Intent to Use trademark depends on the number of classes that you need to register your trademark under. Generally, you’ll pay a separate filing fee for each class of goods or services that you need to register. Each filing fee is currently $225 per class. So, if you needed to register your trademark under three classes, you’d pay a total of $675. 

In addition to the filing fee, you may also need to pay additional fees depending on the services that you need. For example, if you hire an attorney to represent you in the filing process, you’ll need to pay their fees. You may also need to pay fees for certain services, such as a search of existing trademarks or a trademark monitoring service. 

It’s important to note that filing an Intent to Use trademark is just the first step in the trademark registration process. Once you’ve filed your Intent to Use, you’ll need to wait for the USPTO to review your application and approve it. If the USPTO approves your application, you’ll then need to file a Statement of Use, which will require additional fees. 

Overall, the cost of filing an Intent to Use trademark can vary depending on the number of classes and services that you need. However, it’s important to remember that investing in a trademark is an important step to protecting your brand, and the cost of registration is usually worth it in the long run.
