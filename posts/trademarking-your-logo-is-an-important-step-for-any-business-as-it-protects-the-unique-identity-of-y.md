Trademarking your logo is an important step for any business, as it protects the unique identity of your brand and helps to distinguish it from competitors. In New Zealand, there are a few different steps you must take to successfully trademark your logo.

Firstly, you'll need to conduct a trademark search to make sure your logo is original and that no other company has already registered a similar logo. This is important as you don't want to be infringing on someone else's trademark. You can do this online with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand.

Once you've established that your logo is original, you'll need to file an application with the Intellectual Property Office. This application must include a representation of your logo, your contact details, the reasons why you believe the logo is suitable for trademarking, and the classes of goods and services it will be used for.

Once your application is received, a trademark examiner will assess it and provide their opinion. If they think your logo meets the criteria for trademarking, it will be advertised in the Official Gazette for two months so that anyone who believes your logo might infringe on their rights can make a complaint.

If no complaints are made during the advertising period, your logo will be officially trademarked and you'll receive a certificate of registration. Your trademark will be valid for 10 years and can be renewed afterwards if necessary.

Trademarking your logo is a great way to protect the unique identity of your brand and ensure that others can't use it without your permission. Follow these steps to get your logo trademarked in New Zealand and you'll be one step closer to successfully building your brand.
