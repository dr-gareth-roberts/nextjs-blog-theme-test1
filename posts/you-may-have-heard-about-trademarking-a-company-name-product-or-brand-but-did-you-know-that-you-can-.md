You may have heard about trademarking a company name, product or brand, but did you know that you can also trademark your own name? This means that you can protect your personal brand from being used or exploited by others. In the UK, it’s possible to register your own name as a registered trademark under the Trade Marks Act 1994.

What is a trademark?

A trademark is essentially a sign which distinguishes the products or services of one business from another. It could be a logo, a word, a phrase or a slogan. The purpose of the trademark is to protect the brand identity of a business and give it a legal right to exclusive use of that sign.

Why would you want to trademark your own name?

Trademarking your own name is a great way to protect your personal brand, especially if you’re a public figure or influencer. By registering your name as a trademark, you can prevent others from using it in a way which may be damaging to your reputation. It also prevents other people from registering your name as a trademark or using it to promote their own products or services.

What do you need to do to trademark your own name?

In order to trademark your own name in the UK, you’ll need to submit an application to the Intellectual Property Office. The application must include a copy of the name which you’re trying to trademark and a list of the goods and services it will be used for. You’ll also need to provide a description of the intended use of the trademark and the date of first use of the name. Once the application has been submitted, it will be examined by the relevant authorities and, if accepted, your name will be registered as a trademark.

It’s important to note that registering your own name as a trademark doesn’t give you an automatic right to exclusive use of it. In order to maintain the protection of your trademark, you must use it continuously and actively prevent others from using it without your permission.

Trademarking your own name is a great way to protect your personal brand and ensure that it’s not exploited by others. If you’re considering trademarking your own name, it’s important to understand the process and the implications of doing so.
