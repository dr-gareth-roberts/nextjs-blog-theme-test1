Trademarks are an important part of any business. Not only do they help to protect your brand and its products, but they also act as a way to distinguish your business from your competitors. With that said, how often do you need to renew trademarks?

The answer to this question depends on the type of trademark you have registered. If you have a registered trademark, then you must renew it every ten years. This ensures that your mark remains valid and that you can continue to use it as a source of protection.

If you have an unregistered trademark, then you do not need to renew it. However, it is still important to use it in order to maintain a certain level of protection. This means that you should use it consistently and prominently in order to ensure that others are not able to copy or use it without your knowledge.

Finally, if you have a service mark, then you will need to renew it every five years. This is to ensure that you are able to continue using the mark commercially, and that it remains valid.

Overall, it is important to remember that trademarks need to be renewed in order to remain valid. Whether you have a registered, unregistered, or service mark, make sure that you stay on top of renewals in order to keep your mark up-to-date and fully protected.
